# Reusable React Agent Framework - Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Your React agent is hardcoded with specific tools (web_search, calculate) and model (gemma3:27b), making it unusable for different use cases and limiting adoption.

**Goal:** Transform the agent into a flexible, reusable framework that allows users to:
- Plug in their own custom tools
- Use any LLM model/provider
- Configure agent behavior without code changes
- Integrate into existing applications easily

## End Goals & Requirements

**Core Framework Features:**
- Plugin-based tool system with standardized interfaces
- Model-agnostic architecture supporting any LLM provider
- Configuration-driven setup (JSON/YAML)
- Built-in tool registry and discovery
- Async execution support
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

**User Experience:**
- Simple API for registering custom tools
- Drop-in replacement for existing agent workflows
- Minimal setup required
- Clear documentation and examples
- Debugging and monitoring capabilities

**Extensibility:**
- Support for different reasoning patterns (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, etc.)
- Custom prompt templates
- Middleware system for preprocessing/postprocessing
- Integration with popular ML frameworks

## Test Cases

**Tool Registration Tests:**
- Register custom tool with valid schema
- Register tool with invalid schema (should fail gracefully)
- Register duplicate tool names (should handle conflicts)
- Unregister tools and verify removal
- Load tools from external modules/packages

**Model Integration Tests:**
- Use OpenAI GPT models
- Use Anthropic Claude models
- Use local Ollama models
- Use custom model providers via API
- Handle model failures and timeouts
- Test different model response formats

**Agent Execution Tests:**
- Simple single-tool execution
- Multi-step reasoning with tool chaining
- Error recovery when tools fail
- Maximum iteration limits
- Concurrent tool execution
- State persistence across conversations

**Configuration Tests:**
- Load agent config from JSON file
- Override config via environment variables
- Invalid configuration handling
- Dynamic configuration updates
- Template-based prompt customization

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- **E-commerce Assistant:** Custom tools for inventory check, price lookup, order processing
- **Data Analysis Agent:** Tools for database queries, visualization, statistical analysis
- **DevOps Helper:** Tools for server monitoring, deployment, log analysis
- **Research Assistant:** Tools for paper search, citation management, summarization
- **Customer Support:** Tools for ticket lookup, knowledge base search, escalation

**Edge Case Tests:**
- Tool returns malformed JSON
- Infinite loop detection and prevention
- Large tool outputs (truncation handling)
- Network connectivity issues
- Memory limits with long conversations
- Concurrent agent instances
